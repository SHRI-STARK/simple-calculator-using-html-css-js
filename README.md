# simple-calculator-using-html-css-js
I am a beginner and a i have an urge to become a web developer.
I created this calculator as a practice by watching youtube tutorials.
I used HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT to make the calculator.
Create buttons,container and input box using html and stylised with css.then i wrote logic in js a function called EVAL() for mathematical operations.
Then added event listeners to take the input.
